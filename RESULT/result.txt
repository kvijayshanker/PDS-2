Update the NA values of Mileage, Engine and electricity with median
Median is the high-quality alternative technique because it preserves the principal tendency and avoids outliers
Update the NA values of Seat with Mode. number of seats is discrete in nature, although it is quantitative value so mode is used
As there are numerous null values incase of Newprice, it's far better to drop a column due to the fact imputing any values can bring about outliers in the data and lead to incorrect analysis
